# CS 389 HW_04 - Let's Network...!
### Names : Prasun and Hrishee

## File Overview
`hw_4_network.zip` : zip file submission of our repository. See below as to why we needed to use a zip file. Inside the `zip` file we have:

We'll go over the new files (we elide descriptions of anything from HW3 and HW2, since those files are pretty much the same. Except `cache.hh` which now has an additional constructor):
`cache_server.cc` : Implementation of an asynchronous HTTP cache server using the [Crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow) framework.

`cache_client.cpp` : Implementation of a synchronous cache client that makes API requests to a cache server. It uses the [cpr](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr) framework.

`testy_client.cc` : Our testing file that has unit tests for the cache client functionality. It also uses the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) framework.

`CMakeLists.txt` : For building. It should build all three executables `testy_cache`, `server`, `testy_client`. Since we also did our evictor tests inside the `testy_cache.cc` file for HW3, we don't have a `test_evictors.cc` file.

## Getting Started
**Important** : You must use a **Mac** environment. Building does not work on the Linux Virtual Machine (as far as we tried).
### What you need
Catch2, Crow, cpr, cmake, make, Boost (must have boost version 1.69 specifically. Doesn't work with other versions due to crow.).


We'll go over how to manage these dependencies and compile in the next section. We've provided a `zip` file containing all our
 homework implementation as well as the necessary libraries (except boost 1.69.0, which you have to download and configure yourself - we help you below). Managing these dependencies was a nightmare for us. We hope that our zip file will make your life easier instead of having you manually download and configure the crow and `cpr` libraries which caused
 us a massive headache. (We had to zip the repository because the `cpr` library was too large to upload otherwise).

### How to compile

- If you currently have the correct version of Boost move onto the next step. Otherwise download boost 1.69 from this link: [boost_1_69_0](https://www.boost.org/users/history/). Extract it anywhere you want on your machine by either by double clicking on the file or using the following Terminal Command `tar xvzf boost_1_69_0.tar.bz2`.

- Unzip our zip file. Wherever you unzipped it, `cd` into it in the command line.

- In the `CMakeLists.txt` file, manually change all paths to the `boost_1_69_0` folder to match the path on your machine. Specifically, you should change it 4 times in lines 16,18, 23 and 25 inside the `if` and `else if` part.

- Enter the file in your machine. Then enter the build folder, `cd build`.

- From the build folder, do `cmake ..` then `make`. This should produce the three executables `testy_cache`, `server`, and `testy_client` in the build folder.

### How to run
First off, make sure the server is **running** on the same IP and port as the client (in `testy_client.cc`) before you test the client. Otherwise, the client will (understandably) fail.
To run the server, do `./server` if you just want to use the default parameters (explained below), or do `./server -m X -s Y -p Z -t W` where X is maxmem, Y is the host IP address, Z is the port number, and W is the number of threads. (Currently, the server is single threaded even if you give  W > 1).

Then, to test the client, run `./testy_client`. All the test cases should pass. You can also make manual HTTP requests on a separate command line window using something like `curl`.
Sample `curl` command line usage is :

`curl -X HEAD localhost:2001/`

`curl -X PUT localhost:2001/key/value`

`curl -X POST localhost:2001/reset`

`curl -X DELETE localhost:2001/key`

`curl -X GET localhost:2001/key`

## TCP Server
Our asynchronous TCP server uses Crow, as mentioned above. Our default settings for the `SERVER_CACHE` are `maxmem = 30`, `server = "127.0.0.1"`, `port = 2001`, `threads = 1`. These can be overwritten via the command line (e.g. `server -m 1024 -s 123.4.5.6 -p 2020 -t 10`). Our server cache uses a default load factor of 0.75, as well as the default hash function (`std::hash`) and default eviction policy (refuse exceeding cache puts). Refer to `cache_server.cc` for further implementation details.

## TCP Client
Refer to `cache_client.cpp` for implementation details. We used a library called C++ Requests, or cpr, for short (linked above). As for the issue of memory ownership of the pointer from `Cache::get()`, we maintained a vector of returned char pointers in the implementation and destructed each one in the destructor of the actual `Cache` object. This means that the returned pointers will be tied to the life and death of the Cache client object.
